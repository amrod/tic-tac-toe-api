##Game Description:
Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game where players who take turns marking the spaces
in a 3Ã—3 grid with X and O marks. The player who succeeds in placing three of their
marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Scores are recorded when a game ends. The winner and loser are recorded, along with
the number of moves made by the winner and the date in which the score was recorded.

In this API implementation two independent players can compete against each other.
